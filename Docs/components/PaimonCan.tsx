      <p>Paimon can help you â€”</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep track of your daily resin.</li>
        <li>Monitor your daily expeditions and real-time realm currency.</li>
        <li>Remind you about your daily commissions and weekly boss fights.</li>
        <li>
          And notify you when your parametric transformer is ready to use.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Basically, Paimon lives in your macOS menu bar quietly, and offers you a
        nice way of monitoring your in-game real-time stats when you need to
        check them.

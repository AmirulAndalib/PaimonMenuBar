## What's this?

![screenshot](Assets/screenshot.jpg)

> Paimon helps you track your Genshin Impact daily resin, expeditions, and more ‚Äî straight in your macOS menu bar.

Paimon can help you ‚Äî

* üåô Keep track of your daily resin.
* üí∞ Monitor your daily expeditions and real-time realm currency.
* üèÅ Remind you about your daily commissions and weekly boss fights.
* üçØ And notify you when your parametric transformer is ready to use.

Basically, `PaimonMenuBar` lives in your macOS menu bar quietly, and offers you a nice way of monitoring your in-game real-time stats when you need to check them.

> **Note**
>
> `PaimonMenuBar` is made with SwiftUI, designed for and native to macOS.

## Download

[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/spencerwooo/PaimonMenuBar?labelColor=282c34&logo=GitHub&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/spencerwooo/PaimonMenuBar/releases/latest)

## Things to know

1. Paimon uses the official Hoyoverse API found in either [Á±≥Ê∏∏Á§æ (for CN players)](https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/) or [HoYoLAB (for Global players)](https://www.hoyolab.com/home).
2. Yes, Paimon needs your cookie. It is so that Paimon can request said API on your behalf, and fetch those in-game stats periodically. Rest assured that **the cookie is only stored locally.**
3. Check [FAQ](https://paimon.swo.moe/) if you have anymore questions.

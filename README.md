# PaimonMenuBar

![Screenshot](Assets/screenshot.png)

Paimon's now in your menu bar! *Requires macOS 12.0+ (for now).*

> There is no pre-built package available for download yet, stay tuned!

## What's this?

Genshin Impact has got a complicated daily-system, consisting of:

* 4 Daily commisions
* 5 Expeditions
* 3~6 Weekly bosses
* and most importantly: **Resin** capped at 160

Keeping track of these things daily to decide whether it is time to log into Genshin Impact is a pain-in-the-ass. Hence, I present: `PaimonMenuBar`.

`PaimonMenuBar` is a native SwiftUI app living only in your macOS menu bar, and Paimon periodically pulls data from the Mihoyo API to update your latest in-game statistics - so you can decide whether it's time to continue the grind in that stupid artifact domain ;).

## TO-DO

* [x] Menu bar of varying height.
* [x] Configurable data refresh rate.
* [x] Start at login.
* [ ] Backward-compatibility for macOS 11.0.
* [ ] `i18n` support for at least Simplified Chinese and English.
* [ ] Manual refresh button.
* [ ] Code-sign and publish as `.dmg`.
* [ ] Auto-updates and check for update.
* [ ] Support for multiple accounts.
* [ ] Support for hoyolab? (Maybe)
